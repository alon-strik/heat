Installing OpenDaylight
--------------------------
If you are using a full image, OpenDaylight is pre-installed. If you are using a minimal image, OpenDaylight must be installed.
The OpenDaylight project provides zip and tar distributions of each release. CloudRouter takes these distributions, adds some modifications, and then packages them as RPMs. Installation is as simple as running:

$ sudo yum install -y opendaylight-lithium
Running OpenDaylight
Before running OpenDaylight for the first time, you need to create karaf credentials. The upstream distributions of OpenDaylight includes default credentials (karaf/karaf), which have been removed from CloudRouter for security reasons. To create karaf credentials, edit /opt/opendaylight/opendaylight-lithium/etc/users.properties. You will see a commented out user:
# karaf = karaf,_g_:admingroup
Replace this with your own credentials, e.g.:
user = password,_g_:admingroup
To start OpenDaylight:
$ sudo systemctl start opendaylight-lithium
To check the status of OpenDaylight:
$ sudo systemctl status opendaylight-lithium
To connect to the karaf console via SSH:
$ ssh -p 8101 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no <USER>@localhost
Where <USER> matches the karaf credentials you created. You will then be prompted to enter the karaf password you set.
To stop OpenDaylight:

$ sudo systemctl stop opendaylight-lithium

Uninstalling OpenDaylight
$ sudo yum remove -y opendaylight-lithium






sudo systemctl start opendaylight-helium
sudo systemctl status opendaylight-helium

sudo systemctl status firewalld.service

ssh -p 8101 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no cloudrouter@localhost





vi  /opt/opendaylight/opendaylight-helium/etc/users.properties

add line - 
cloudrouter = Password,_g_:admingroup

to access kafka : 
/opt/opendaylight/opendaylight-helium/bin/kafka
ssh -p 8101 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no cloudrouter@localhost
